In this project, we have conducted an in-depth analysis of the six most well-known tickers by applying various strategies, including correlations, financial health assessments, and predictive and statistical measures.

Our objective was to combine and analyze all relevant ratios and measures to derive the most useful and accurate insights from our data. We aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of each ticker's performance and potential future movements.

While some sections provide conclusions and definitions, feel free to focus solely on the narrative behind the graphs. The **Final Conclusion** will suffice for a comprehensive understanding.

The data used in this analysis is sourced from real-world data provided by yfinance, which I utilized in Python to download the stock prices for each ticker. Additionally, I used Stock Analysis Site to load the quarterly financial statements for each company. This approach ensured that our analysis was grounded in the most current and relevant financial data available.

The project includes all related data and analyses, which I have completed in Excel and Power BI. The data file contains detailed analyses, including various financial ratios, correlation matrices, and predictive models. Additionally, you will find:

Graphical Representations: Visualizations in Power BI and Excel that highlight trends, patterns, and key insights.

Financial Health Reports: Detailed reports on the financial stability and performance of each company.

Predictive Models: Statistical models used to forecast future price movements and volatility for each ticker.

This comprehensive approach ensures that the analysis is robust and actionable. By reviewing the provided data and visualizations, you can gain a clear understanding of each ticker's potential future performance based on current and historical financial data.

In summary, this project offers a thorough examination of the selected tickers, leveraging advanced analytical tools and real-world data to provide valuable insights for informed decision-making. All related data and analyses are included in the accompanying Excel and Power BI files for your detailed review.
